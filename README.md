## Development Environment Configuration

Download the files from this repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Derhks/DonRep.git
```

Create a virtual environment with Anaconda

```bash
conda create -n donrep_test python=3.8 -y
```

Now, let's activate the created virtual environment

```bash
conda activate donrep_test
```

With the virtual environment activated we are going to install
the requirements used in the project

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

We must export the environment variables that we need in our project.
Change the name of the `example.env` file to `.env`, fill in the
environment variables with their corresponding value and finally execute
the following command:

```bash
export $(cat .env | grep -v ^# | xargs)
```

The application has its unit tests, run the following command:

```bash
coverage run -m unittest discover

```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --use-colors
